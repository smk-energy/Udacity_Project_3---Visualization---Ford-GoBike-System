# (Dataset Exploration for FordGo Bike System)

## About Project

> This is my third project in the Udacity Data Analysis Nano degree. In this project I worked on the Ford GoBike System Dataset. The data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. There are thousands of bikes to pick up and drop off anywhere, available 24/7 and throughtout the year. Riders who sign up as members or buy passes get access to all the bikes within the network of Ford GoBike. The project involved three main stages: data wrangling of the GoFord Bike system dataset, data analysis, and data visualization. My main goal was to uncover consumers' usage patterns and bike demand trends in the system by analyzing and visualizing the given data.

> Here with the README:md file, I have attached two other files: the first file is a Jupyter notebook written in Python for the exploratory data analysis phase of the project. This notebook includes univariate, bivariate, and multivariate data exploration, which generated over 16 different insights through visualizations of the dataset.

> The second file is a slide deck that summarizes four most important insights generated from the analyzed Ford GoBike data.


## Dataset

>  Ford GoBike is a bicycle sharing system that operates within the San Francisco Bay Area in California. Similar to other bike share programs, it employs a collection of sturdy bicycles that are secured into docking stations dispersed throughout the city. The bicycles are particularly suited for one-way trips since they can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station within the network. They are available for use all year round, 24 hours a day, and seven days a week, with membership or pass holders being able to access all bicycles in the network.In the initial data wrangling phase, certain columns in the dataset required clean-up of their data types and unnecessary columns were removed. This analysis specifically focused on Ford GoBike's trip data for public containing rides recorded in February 2019.

## Summary of Findings

> In this project's analysis, two types of users were identified: subscribers and customers. The subscriber group constitutes the majority of the customer base for For GoBike System, accounting for 90.5% of the total data entries. Thursday emerged as the day with the highest demand for bike rides, the next is tuesday, both days within the week. An overview of the data suggested that subscribers primarily use the system for work commutes due to the short distances and ride durations observed during the analysis. 

> Another key finding is that the male gender were found to be the dominant bike users, despite the fact that female riders tend to ride for longer durations. The age group between 25 to 35 years appeared to be the most popular bike user demographic. 

> Moreso, It was also observed that customers spend more bike trip duration than subscribers. Finally, the analysis revealed that mornings and evenings have the highest demand for bike rides among both user groups, with bike orders mostly occurring during the mornings, 8:00 to 9:00 and evenings 17:00 to 18:00.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focused on the frequencies of bike rides per hour, day, and more importantly the user type (customer and subscriber). I start by checking out trip frequencies by hours and days of the week and the user type using pointplot and barcharts. I also looked into how Gender and User type influence the Bike System Rentage focusing on Weekly Trips

> The usage for bikes during the week is also visualized using a heatmap.
